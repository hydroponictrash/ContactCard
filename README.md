Hey, my name is Andre but I go by HydroponicTrash online. Why HydroponicTrash? Because I build indoor vertical gardens from trash and other recycled things. I'm a hacker, a gardener, and an overall weirdo. I write alot about solarpunk (links down below to learn more), anarchism, ecosocialism, hacking, permacomputing, and a ton of other topics.

## Socials
I post mainly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HydroponicTrash).

For my fediverse friends and fellow nerds, I'm also on [Mastodon](https://kolektiva.social/@hydroponictrash).
For long form content I post on [Substack](https://anarchosolarpunk.substack.com/archive) where I have DIY articles, short solarpunk fiction, and tutorials on anything from building your own off-grid solar power stations, building autonomous off-grid internet, things about social ecology and solarpunk, along with posts that outline how we can build post-capitalist futures.

I also make videos on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@hydroponictrash)

Find me pretty much anywhere by looking for @HydroponicTrash

- I tend to drink whiskey neat, but can go for any drink. Beer wise I love stouts and coffee flavored beers. 
- Cigars are always good with me. I like Drew Estates Java the most. 
- If you know where to get sour gummy sharks let me know.
